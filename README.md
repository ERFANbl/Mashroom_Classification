# Mashroom_Classification
This project classifies mushrooms as edible or poisonous using a deep learning approach with TensorFlow. The model processes physical features of mushrooms, such as cap shape and color, through a neural network designed for binary classification. It achieves high accuracy, offering a reliable tool for foraging safety and ecological studies
